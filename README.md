## **üë©üèΩ‚Äçüíª Setup & Execution**

* To reproduce this project, first clone the repository using git clone https://github.com/your-username/dermatology-ai. Then, set up the environment by creating a virtual environment (e.g., using python -m venv env) and activating it.

* This project is designed to run in Kaggle Notebooks, so no local dataset downloads are necessary. 

* The dataset is automatically available via the competition page at /kaggle/input/bttai-ajl-2025/ once you join the Break Through Tech x Algorithmic Justice League competition on Kaggle.

## **üèóÔ∏è Project Overview**

* This project was developed as part of the Break Through Tech AI Program in collaboration with the Algorithmic Justice League through a Kaggle-hosted competition. The competition challenges participants to build inclusive machine learning models capable of classifying dermatological conditions from images across diverse skin tones. 
 * The primary objective is to address bias in dermatology AI tools, which historically underperform for people with darker skin due to underrepresentation in training data.
 * By creating a fairer and more accurate classification model, our work has the potential to reduce diagnostic errors, improve early detection, and promote equitable healthcare outcomes for marginalized communities. This project not only advances technical performance in medical AI but also contributes to broader efforts in algorithmic fairness and social impact.

## **üìä Data Exploration**

* Dataset: The dataset we used is a subset of the FitzPatrick17k dataset. This is a labeled collection of around 17,000 images that depict serious and cosmetic dermatological conditions such as melanoma and acne among a range of skin tones scored on the FitzPatrick skin tone scale. We took a sample of around 4,500 images from this dataset, which represented 21 skin conditions out of over 100.

* Data Exploration and Preprocessing: To begin exploring our data, we viewed the variety of images that contained skin conditions, as outlined by the "Evaluating Deep Neural Networks Trained on Skin Images with the Fitzpatrick 17k Dataset" video provided to us. We also examined the metadata provided to us as well as conducted our own research on how machine learning is currently being tested in real clinical settings to help with determining and treating dermatalogical conditions.

* After exploring the data and performing filename adjustments such as constructing file paths, we started data preprocessing beginning with using scikit-learn‚Äôs LabelEncoder to transform string labels into integers. We split the data into training and validation sets and used the ImageDataGenerator to preprocess image data by rescaling pixel values from their original range (0‚Äì255) to a normalized range. We used the helper function create_generator to generate batches of image data directly from the dataframe, and then were able to train a Keras Sequential CNN model.
  
* Challenges we faced: A major challenge that we faced when working with this dataset for our Kaggle competition was the fact that we needed to work with image data using convolutional neural networks instead of the traditional deep neural networks that we were used to using. In addition, we made a few assumptions about our data, in particular assuming that all images can be uniformly resized to the target size without losing critical information.
